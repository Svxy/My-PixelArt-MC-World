## Hello!
### This is my pixel art world!
# Minecraft Version 1.12.0 !!

### Currently a work in progress as i want to have many many displays, but while i currently only have two i wanted to share this world w the public.

## How to use my world:
### (For people unfamiliar with github and minecraft java)
### First off, click the button that says "code" in green. Click "download as a zip", then once its installed into your downloads right click the file select "extract files", select your desktop and click ok. Now, once the files on your desktop you can delete the zip. After that navigate to your ".minecraft" folder, which should typically be located in "C:\Users\your_profile\AppData\Roaming\\.minecraft". Now click on the saves folder and drag in "c̶u̶t̶i̶e̶y̶ツ゚'s PixelArt" (My world file). Then when you open Minecraft 1.12.0 and select singleplayer, the world should appear!

# Enjoy!!
